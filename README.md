    * Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground to score points.
    * Game over when the bird hits a pipe or the ground.

* **Visuals:**
    * Simple yet visually appealing 2D graphics.
    * Smooth animations for bird flapping and pipe movement.
    * Background with scrolling clouds for added immersion.

* **Sound Effects:**
    * Engaging sound effects for bird flapping, pipe collisions, and scoring.

* **User Interface:**
